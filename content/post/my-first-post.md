## Rabbit gone...

The first post on my site is a sad one :-(

For almost 10 year our rabbit was part of the family. 
It survived two marter attack which killed 2 other rabbits.
After 30 Decmber 2020 the rabbit somehow disappeared. Most likely it got sick, went under ground through the tunnels and died...
