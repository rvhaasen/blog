Already 2 years ago I wanted to build a Prusa MK3 printer. Last years
black-friday, Prusa had an interesting offer which i could not refuse!


The box arrived last week of 2020. 
It took me slight more than 2 days to assemble the printer. The package contains a book with clear instructions. Having build a first one, a second printer would take much less time, I think it could then be build in about 1.5 day.

Here some additional pictures:
